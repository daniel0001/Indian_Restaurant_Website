				<p>There are many varieties of dishes called 'curries'. For example, in original traditional cuisines, the precise selection of spices for each dish is a matter of national or regional cultural tradition, religious practice, and, to some extent, family preference. </p><p>Such dishes are called by specific names that refer to their ingredients, spicing, and cooking methods.[3] Traditionally, spices are used both whole and ground; cooked or raw; and they may be added at different times during the cooking process to produce different results.

					</figure><p>The paste is fried in split coconut cream until the oil is expressed to release the aromas in the paste. Once the curry paste is cooked, more coconut milk and the remaining ingredients are added along with a pinch of palm sugar and fish sauce. Finally, as garnishes, Thai basil, fresh kaffir lime leaves, sliced phrik chi fa ("sky-pointing chilies", large mild chilies) are often used.</p><p>For a more robust green curry, such as with seafood, julienned krachai (fingerroot/wild ginger/Chinese keys), white turmeric, and holy basil can be used as garnishes

					<article class="box boxHover"><h2>Spice Defined</h2>
					<figure><img class="imgWrapper" id="left" src="images/spices.jpg" alt="Market spices"> 
					</figure><p>A spice is a seed, fruit, root, bark, or other plant substance primarily used for flavoring, coloring or preserving food. Spices are distinguished from herbs, which are the leaves, flowers, or stems from plants used for flavoring or as a garnish. Sometimes, spices may be ground into a powder for convenience.</p><p> Many spices have antimicrobial properties. This may explain why spices are more commonly used in warmer climates, which have more infectious diseases, and why the use of spices is prominent in meat, which is particularly susceptible to spoiling.[1] Spices are sometimes used in medicine, religious rituals, cosmetics or perfume production, or as a vegetable.
